Name = Dace (EET Version)

Author = Tess Grey

Description = Dace Linton is a chaotic neutral wiry bounty hunter. She seems very fond of the notion of practicality but doesn't always practice what she preaches and stands out by being sarcastic and cranky; only brief moments show her insight and kindness. You can find the woman with the distinctive grin and many voiced dialogues on Waukeen's Promenade.
